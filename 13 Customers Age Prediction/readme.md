# Customers Age Prediction

## Task
Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. There is a set of photographs of people with age indication.

## Description
A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
* Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
* Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.

A model has been built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph.
A set of photographs of people with age indication was analyzed using computer vision using ready-made neural networks and the Keras library.
