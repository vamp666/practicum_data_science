# Protection of personal data of clients


## Task
Data conversion method to protect the personal information of the insurance company's customers.

## Description
To protect the data of the clients of the insurance company, data conversion methods have been developed so that it is difficult to recover personal information from them.
The data was preprocessed. The operation of the linear regression model algorithm was tested when multiplied by an invertible matrix. The influence of multiplication on an invertible matrix, and then multiplication on the inverse matrix of an invertible one, was checked. The R2 metric of Linear Regression was tested on identical data - first, the original data, then multiplied by an invertible matrix, the size of which is equal to the number of features. The metrics are exactly the same. It can be concluded that the algorithm works.
