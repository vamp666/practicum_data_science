# Recovery of gold from ore


## Task
Development of a model that predicts the recovery factor of gold from gold ore.

## Description
The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of the gold mining industry.
A model has been built that predicts the recovery factor of gold from gold-bearing ore. Analyzed data with parameters of extraction and purification.
A model has been built and trained to help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.
