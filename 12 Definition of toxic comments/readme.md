# Definition of toxic comments


## Task
Speed up the moderation of comments in the community by automating the assessment of their toxicity.
Train the model to classify comments into positive and negative.

## Description
To launch a new service, an online store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and send them for moderation. Users can edit and add product descriptions, just like in a community wiki. That is, clients propose their edits and comment on the changes of others.
The model was trained to classify comments into positive and negative ones. A data set with labeling on the toxicity of edits was analyzed.
A model was built with the value of the quality metric F1 not less than 0.75.
The feature engineering technique was applied to texts and time series.
Texts are vectorized using word2vec, GloVe, FastText.
