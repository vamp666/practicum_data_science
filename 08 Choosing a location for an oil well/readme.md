# Choosing a location for an oil well


## Task
Decide in which region to produce oil. Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

## Description
The mining company needs to decide where to drill a new well.
The characteristics of oil samples for wells are collected: the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known.
A model was built to predict the volume of reserves in new wells.
The wells with the highest value estimates were selected.
The regions with the maximum total profit of the selected wells were determined.
A model has been built to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. The possible profit and risks of the Bootstrap technique are analyzed.
